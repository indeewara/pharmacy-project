Description

Brief description of the project.
Prerequisites

    Node.js installed on your machine.

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>

    Navigate into the project directory:


cd <project-directory>


    Install dependencies:

npm install


Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

    Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

    Run the following command to start the server:


npm start


    Once the server is running, you can use Postman or any other HTTP client to test the endpoints.



Testing Endpoints

    Use Postman to send requests to the server endpoints.

    Make sure to include the necessary data in the request body, headers, or parameters as required.

    To access protected endpoints, you need to log in first.

    Use the generated JWT token from the login response to authenticate subsequent requests.


Authentication

    Send a POST request to the /login endpoint with the necessary login credentials (e.g., username and password).

    Upon successful login, the server will respond with a JWT token.

    Include the JWT token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.
